1. I need to figure out which version the network status is before I pick the appropriate class.
2. Sort of unclear what "Consensus Attributes" and "Vote Attributes" headings mean in doc for NetworkStatusDocumentV3 class (https://stem.torproject.org/api/descriptor/networkstatus.html). I take it these variables are only meaningful (and possibly only present) if is_consensus==True / is_vote==True, respectively.
3. In Descriptor doc (https://stem.torproject.org/api/descriptor/reader.html), return type from DescriptorReader not explicitly mentioned. It is described as "descriptor data"; code example suggest it is an iterator over Descriptor objects.
4. Stem has syntax errors under python 3.
5. Consensuses from <https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html> include a "@type network-status-consensus-3 1.0" or similar annotation at the beginning of each file. The NetworkStatusDocumentV3
constructor dies on this line (removing it fixes the problem).
6. Documentation: What does print do on each object?
7. Need to test if exit allows access to a port on *some* IP address for choosing exits when the IP of the destination is unknown.

Rough guide:
- pathsim.py: Path simulator code (aka Torps). Needs Tor's stem library, consensuses, and descriptors.
- pathsim_analysis.py: Some code for analyzing Torps output.
- stem comments.txt: Running observations on stem for Damian.
- path spec notes.txt: Errors or omissions in Tor's path-spec.txt that need to be fixed.
- test.py: Unorganized useful test code for Torps.
